You need ANDROID_HOME set to use command line maven to build the project.

To use this archetype in Eclipse you will need to have the following installed:
* Eclipse m2e (maven integration)
* Xtend Eclipse plugin
* Android Eclipse plugin
You may also need to clean the project after generating from the archetype in order for the .xtend file to be processed.

To use the android support library (support-v4.jar and friends) see the instructions in pom.xml.
